This repository contains a fork of [Emacs](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs) with some personal modifications.

Additions on the [master](https://github.com/didierverna/emacs/tree/master) branch:
- this file (`README.md`),
- a new Lisp variable called `build-time-exec-path`. Its use is described in [this](http://www.didierverna.net/blog/index.php?post/2013/05/14/Emacs-session-bootstrap-tweaks) blog.

The [cutebar](https://github.com/didierverna/emacs/tree/cutebar) branch (a personal one, sync'ed with master) holds my implementation of menubar icons support on MacOS X. It was described in [this](http://www.didierverna.net/blog/index.php?post/2013/09/03/Menu-bar-icons-for-Emacs) blog.

WARNING: all my local branches, including master, are (un)regularly rebased on top of upstream [Emacs](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs), and pushed with -f on GitHub!
