This repository contains a fork of [Emacs](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs) with some personal modifications.

Currently, there's one additional branch (sync'ed with the master
branch) called [cutebar](https://github.com/didierverna/emacs/tree/cutebar). This branch holds my implementation of menubar icons support on MacOS X. It was described in [this](http://www.didierverna.net/blog/index.php?post/2013/09/03/Menu-bar-icons-for-Emacs) blog.

WARNING: all my local branches, including master, in which I added this file (README.md), are rebased on top of upstream [Emacs](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs), and pushed with -f on GitHub!
